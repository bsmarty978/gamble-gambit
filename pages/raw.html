<ul>
    <li>Ping 2.0 – The regular yellow ping will now be numbered, with each player assigned a number at the beginning of each match. Pings will now also be contextual, so when players ping gadgets, the defuser, and other objects of interest, the ping icon
        will change to reflect which item is pinged (e.g. ping a Frost trap and your ping icon will show Frost’s icon). Players can also now ping from cameras and drones.</li>
    <li>Weapon optics – New scopes and new magnification levels have been added, and the classic ACOG is now known as the 2.5x scope. There is a new red dot sight and a new holographic sight, though the previous designs are still in play. Some Operators now
        have different optics for different guns, and players can customize the color and opacity of their reticles. </li>
    <li>Reinforcement pool – Instead of every Defender having two reinforcements to deploy on walls and hatches, the defending team will now draw from a pool of ten reinforcements. So, for example, a speedy player could run to upper floors and reinforce more
        than two hatches, and anchors won’t have to worry about roamers leaving the site without first reinforcing.</li>
    <li>Hard-breaching secondary gadget – A new secondary gadget for Attackers will allow them to breach a sizeable hole in reinforced walls (big enough to vault through) or destroy reinforced hatches. While it is vulnerable to destruction in the usual ways,
        this means that Attackers will have more hard-breaching options beyond Thermite, Hibana, Maverick, and Ace’s gadgets.</li>
    <li>EMP grenade rework – Thatcher has long been the scourge of Defender gadgets with his destructive EMP grenade, but now his EMP blasts will only disable enemy gadgets, not destroy them. The gadgets will come back online once this disabled state ends,
        so Attackers will have to time their pushes to take advantage of this window of opportunity, while Defenders keen on Bandit tricking will have to adapt their tactics.</li>
    <li>My Siege Stats – A new tool on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Rainbow Six website</a>, My Siege Stats will give you a detailed breakdown of your in-game performance
        so you can identify your strengths and spot areas of improvement.</li>
    <li>Match Replay – Available on the PC test server, the alpha phase of match replay will allow players to load up any of their past 12 matches and view the replay from the spectator camera view or from the perspective of any player in the match. Whether
        you use it to analyze your opponents or relive your highlights, be sure to give the team feedback on the <a href="https://forums.ubisoft.com/forumdisplay.php/64-Rainbow-Six-Siege" target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official forums</a> to
        help them improve the tool.</li>
    <li>Map Ban – A new phase in Ranked and Unranked matches will give teams the chance to ban one map and give them a little more control over the matches they get into. </li>
